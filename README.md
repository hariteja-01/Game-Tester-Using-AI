Game Tester Dashboard
=====================

Overview
--------

The **Game Tester Dashboard** is a Python-based web application built with Streamlit, designed to assist game developers and testers in evaluating game performance, tracking bugs, and analyzing player satisfaction. It generates mock test reports for a predefined list of over 700 popular video games, providing detailed analytics through interactive visualizations. The application includes an AI-powered chatbot, integrated with the Google Gemini API, which offers real-time assistance and supports file uploads (images and text) for analysis. With a sleek, user-friendly interface styled using custom CSS, the dashboard is an effective tool for optimizing game development and testing workflows.
